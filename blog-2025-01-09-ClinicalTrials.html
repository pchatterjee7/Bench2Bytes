            <h2>3. Addressing Omics Disparities</h2>
            <p>
                Current data reveal significant gaps in multi-omics integration across trials. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cancer Studies:</strong> Cancer studies more frequently include genotype data than infectious diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Underrepresented Datasets:</strong> Limited large-scale studies integrate transcriptomics, genotype, and proteomics simultaneously.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Add Figure 1 -->
            <div class="figure-container">
                <img src="images/disease_category_analysis.png" alt="Disease Category Analysis" class="figure-image">
                <p class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Genotype data inclusion across disease categories, using infectious disease and cancer as examples.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>4. Distribution of Omics Type Combinations in Studies</h2>
            <p>
                A detailed analysis of omics type combinations in the top 20 large-scale studies highlights critical gaps in data integration. For example:
